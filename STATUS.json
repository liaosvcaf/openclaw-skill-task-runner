  "notes": "Redesigned from v1.0.0 (one-shot executor) to v2.0.0 (persistent queue + heartbeat dispatcher). Core change: tasks now accumulate in a single queue file; dispatcher runs on heartbeat/cron to execute pending tasks via subagents. Self-play passed: INTAKE mode correctly parsed 3-task message, DISPATCHER executed T-01 (info-lookup) and T-02 (file-creation) successfully, T-03 (impossible: flight booking) correctly blocked after 3 strategies with unblock instructions."
